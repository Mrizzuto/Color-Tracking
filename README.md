# Interactive Color Tracking
An computer vision project based around color tracking and user input

## Concept
My goal in designing this project was to emulate a sort of dissonance between the user and the computer. Providing an ambigious relationship between the users' input and their affect in the virtual space was at the core of this ideology. I set about my idea with a relatively simple premise in mind - simple manipulation of a shape.

## Planning
This project presented a number of questions about 3D space that I had not previously encountered, I think my notes are a reflection of this.

## Execution
I went about designing the project, starting the the polygon in question that would be the subject of user manipulation. In designing the polygon I made sure that It would be skewed and pulled appart in a functional way, and so designing a simple cube out of triangle shaped sections. Below you will see the phyiscal model used as referance as this process proved to be somewhat taxing on my brain.

## Interaction
I wanted the user to be able to interact with the object in a way that would make the tracking points invisible to the user. I had the ides of using colored wands but they had to be light weight and they had to be comfortable as to not attract the attention of the user while they were interacting with the piece. Below are pictures of the wants / tracking points that I made for the project.
